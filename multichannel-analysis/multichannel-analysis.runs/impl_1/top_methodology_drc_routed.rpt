2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock clk_wiz_0_inst/inst/clk_i is defined downstream of clock clk_i and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_i and clk_o_clk_wiz_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_i] -to [get_clocks clk_o_clk_wiz_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_o_clk_wiz_0 and clk_i are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_o_clk_wiz_0] -to [get_clocks clk_i]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_i and clk_o_clk_wiz_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_i] -to [get_clocks clk_o_clk_wiz_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#2 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_o_clk_wiz_0 and clk_i are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_o_clk_wiz_0] -to [get_clocks clk_i]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock clk_wiz_0_inst/inst/clk_i is created on an inappropriate internal pin clk_wiz_0_inst/inst/clk_i. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net clk_i_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): clk_i_IBUF_inst/O, dsp_inst/clk_i, clk_wiz_0_inst/clk_i
