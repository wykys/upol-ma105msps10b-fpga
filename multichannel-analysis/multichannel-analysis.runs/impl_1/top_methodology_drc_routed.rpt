2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock clk_wiz_0_inst/inst/clk_in is defined downstream of clock clk_i and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock clk_wiz_0_inst/inst/clk_in is created on an inappropriate internal pin clk_wiz_0_inst/inst/clk_in. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net clk_i_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): clk_i_IBUF_inst/O, rst_driver_inst/clk_i, clk_wiz_0_inst/clk_in
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell rst_driver_inst/clk_wiz_0_inst_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) clk_wiz_0_inst/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/RST. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on nrst_i relative to clock(s) clk_i
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led_o[1] relative to clock(s) clk_wiz_0_inst/inst/clk_in
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led_o[2] relative to clock(s) clk_wiz_0_inst/inst/clk_in
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led_o[3] relative to clock(s) clk_wiz_0_inst/inst/clk_in
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led_o[4] relative to clock(s) clk_wiz_0_inst/inst/clk_in
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on sram_we_n_o relative to clock(s) clk_wiz_0_inst/inst/clk_in
Related violations: <none>
