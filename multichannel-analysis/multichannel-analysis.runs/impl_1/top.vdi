WARNING: [Opt 31-35] Removing redundant IBUF, clk_wiz_0_inst/inst/clkin1_ibufg, from the path connected to top-level port: clk_i 
Resolution: The tool has removed redundant IBUF. To resolve this warning, check for redundant IBUF in the input design.
WARNING: [Constraints 18-550] Could not create 'IBUF_LOW_PWR' constraint because net 'clk_wiz_0_inst/clk_i' is not directly connected to top level port. Synthesis is ignored for IBUF_LOW_PWR but preserved for implementation.
